abstract = "The newly emerging market for data is insufficiently researched up to now. The survey presented in this work - which is the third iteration of a a series of studies that started in 2012 - intends to provide a deeper understanding of this emerging type of market. Research questions concerning the provider manifestations and the commoditization of data are identified. The findings indicate that data providers focus on limited business models and that data remains individualized and differentiated. Nevertheless, a trend towards commoditization for certain types of data can be foreseen, which even allows an outlook to further developments in this area"
