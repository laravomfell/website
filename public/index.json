Extending existing Hawkes models, we test for the existence of two spillover channels in crime victim reporting: 1. spillovers due to victims responding to other victim reports and 2. spillovers due to victims responding to police action. Despite well-documented spillover effects in other human behaviour, we find no evidence to support such effects in the reporting of domestic abuse.","tags":[],"title":"(No) Spillovers in reporting domestic abuse to police","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lara Vomfell","Jeremias Knoblauch"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612137600,"objectID":"c1b850a6b5fde821d3cd92a56abbc7ef","permalink":"https://laravomfell.github.io/publication/tvd/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tvd/","section":"publication","summary":"Models of discrete-valued outcomes are easily misspecified if the data exhibit zero-inflation, overdispersion or contamination. Without additional knowledge about the existence and nature of this misspecification, model inference and prediction are adversely affected. Here, we introduce a robust discrepancy-based Bayesian approach using the Total Variation Distance (TVD). In the process, we address and resolve two challenges: First, we study convergence and robustness properties of a computationally efficient estimator for the TVD between a parametric model and the data-generating mechanism. Secondly, we provide an efficient inference method adapted from Lyddon et al. (2017) which corresponds to formulating an uninformative nonparametric prior directly over the data-generating mechanism. Lastly, we empirically demonstrate that our approach is robust and significantly improves predictive performance on a range of simulated and real world data.","tags":[],"title":"Robust Bayesian Inference for Discrete Outcomes with the Total Variation Distance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lara Vomfell","Neil Stewart"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"e6bd11d39b7137ee6a88b6337ed1e497","permalink":"https://laravomfell.github.io/publication/ethnic_bias/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ethnic_bias/","section":"publication","summary":"Black and Asian people in the United Kingdom are more likely to be stopped and searched by police than White people. Following a panel of 36,000 searches by 1,100 police officers at a major English police force, we provide officer-specific measures of over-searching relative to two baselines: the ethnic composition of crime suspects officers interact with and the ethnic composition of the areas they patrol. We show that the vast majority of officers over-search ethnic minorities against both baselines. But we also find that the over-searching by individual officers cannot account for all of the over-representation of ethnic minorities in stop and search: over-patrolling of minority areas is also a key factor. Decomposing the overall search bias, we find that the over-representation of Asian people in stop and search is primarily accounted for by over-patrolling, while the over-representation of Black people is a combination of officer and patrol effects, with the larger contribution coming from biases of officers.","tags":[],"title":"Officer bias, over-patrolling and ethnic disparities in stop and search","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lara Vomfell","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

The paper evaluates the explanatory and predictive value of human activity patterns derived from taxi trip, Twitter and Foursquare data. Analysis of a six-month period of crime data for New York City shows that these data sources improve predictive accuracy for property crime by 19% compared to using only demographic data. This effect is strongest when the novel features are used together, yielding new insights into crime prediction. Notably and in line with social disorganisation theory, the novel features cannot improve predictions for violent crimes.","tags":[],"title":"Improving crime count forecasts using Twitter and taxi data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Stahl","Fabian Schomm","Gottfried Vossen","Lara Vomfell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470006000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470006000,"objectID":"b4bfba4bb674a5ebcf3ce9fb70bdbfce","permalink":"https://laravomfell.github.io/publication/classification/","publishdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/classification/","section":"publication","summary":"Trading data as a commodity has become increasingly popular in recent years, and data marketplaces have emerged as a new business model where data from a variety of sources can be collected, aggregated, processed, enriched, bought, and sold. They are effectively changing the way data are distributed and managed on the Internet. To get a better understanding of the emergence of data marketplaces, we have conducted several surveys in recent years to systematically gather and evaluate their characteristics. This paper takes a broader perspective and relates data marketplaces as currently discussed in computer science to the neoclassical notions of market and marketplace from economics. Specifically, we provide a typology of electronic marketplaces and discuss their approaches to the distribution of data. Finally, we provide a distinct definition of data marketplaces, leading to a classification framework that can provide structure for the emerging field of data marketplace research.","tags":[],"title":"A classification framework for data marketplaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
